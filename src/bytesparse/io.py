class MemoryIO(io.BufferedIOBase):
    r"""Buffered I/O wrapper.

    This class wraps an :obj:`ImmutableMemory` object so that the latter can
    be accessed like a typical Python I/O read-only stream.

    A memory stream is writable if, on its creation (:meth:`__init__`), its
    underlying memory object can be written an empty byte string at its start
    address, without raising any exceptions.

    Any operations executed on a closed stream may fail, raising an exception.

    The stream position (the result of :meth:`tell`) indicates the address
    currently pointed by the stream.
    It is just a number, and as such it is allowed to fall outside the actual
    memory bounds.

    The stream position always refers to absolute address 0; in no way it ever
    refers to the :attr:`ImmutableMemory.start` of the underlying wrapped
    memory object.

    Arguments:
        memory (:obj:`ImmutableMemory`):
            The memory object to wrap.
            If ``None``, it assigns a new empty :obj:`bytesparse.Memory`.

        seek (int):
            If ``Ellipsis``, :meth:`seek` to :attr:`memory.start`.
            If not ``None``, :meth:`seek` to the absolute address `seek`.

    Attributes:
        _memory (:obj:`ImmutableMemory`):
            The underlying wrapped memory object.
            It is set to ``None`` when :attr:`closed`.

        _position (int):
            The current stream position.
            It always refers to absolute address 0.

        _writable (bool):
            The stream is writable on creation.

        Starting from the current stream position, this method tries to read up
        to `size` bytes (or as much as possible if negative or ``None``).

        The number of bytes can be less than `size` in the case a memory hole
        or the end are encountered.

        If the current stream position lies within a memory gap, this method
        returns the negative amount of bytes to reach the next data block.

        If the current stream position is after the end of memory data, this
        method returns an empty byte string.

        Arguments:
            size (int):
                Number of bytes to read.
                If negative or ``None``, read as many bytes as possible.

            asmemview (bool):
                Return a :obj:`memoryview` instead of :obj:`bytes`.

        Returns:
            bytes: Chunk of up to `size` bytes.

        Examples:
            >>> from bytesparse import Memory, MemoryIO

            >>> blocks = [[3, b'Hello'], [10, b'World!']]

        The behaviour depends on the nature of `buffer`: byte-like or integer.

        Byte-like data are written into the underlying memory object via its
        :meth:`bytesparse.base.MutableMemory.write` method, at the current stream position
        (i.e. :meth:`tell`).
        The stream position is always incremented by the size of `buffer`,
        regardless of the actual number of bytes written into the
        underlying memory object (e.g. when cropped by existing
        :attr:`bytesparse.base.MutableMemory.bounds_span` settings).

        If `buffer` is a positive integer, that is the amount of bytes to
        :meth:`bytesparse.base.MutableMemory.clear` from the current stream position onwards.
        The stream position is incremented by `buffer` bytes.
        It returns `buffer` as a positive number.

        If `buffer` is a negative integer, that is the amount of bytes to
        :meth:`bytesparse.base.MutableMemory.delete` from the current stream position onwards.
        The stream position is not changed.
        It returns `buffer` as a positive number.

        Notes:
            `buffer` is considered an integer if the execution of
            ``buffer.__index__()`` does not raise an :exc:`Exception`.

        Arguments:
            buffer (bytes):
                Byte data to write at the current stream position.
